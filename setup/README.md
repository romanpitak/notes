# setup log #

This page servers me as a log of software and setup I have done
on my development machine.
I try to install as much as possible locally
(in `$HOME` and withour root access).
I try to keep my `$PATH` as short and clean as possible,
but it's not really possible with `rvm`, `nvm`, `phpenv` and `pyenv` installed.
